# Hyacinth

This is a simple [Nex](https://nightfall.city/nex/info/specification.txt) protocol server.

After building, it can be invoked via `./RFord.Projects.Hyacinth`, where it will listen on the protocol designated port, port `1900`, and host out files as requested by a Nex client.

An optional path can be supplied, e.g. `./RFord.Projects.Hyacinth /var/home/rob` should a user wish to host a directory other than the current working directory.
